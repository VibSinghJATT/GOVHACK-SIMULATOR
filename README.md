# GOVHACK-SIMULATOR
A fake simulator of hacking with many minigames

# GOVHACK SIMULATOR 🕶️💻

**GOVHACK SIMULATOR** is a cross-platform, terminal-based hacking simulation game inspired by classic hacker aesthetics, cyber missions, and retro command-line gameplay.

It is designed to run with **zero dependencies** using native OS scripting:
- Bash (`.sh`)
- PowerShell (`.ps1`)
- Batch (`.bat`)

No game engines. No graphics libraries. Just pure terminal fun.
